# punchcard.com
this is a simple app where both companies and their users can register, and users can then issue a "punch". When they've collected enough punches (usually 10), they will get a discount at the company (perhaps a free meal at a restaurant after buying 10 meals, or 20% discount of their next purchase at some shop etc.).

**2)** go into repo folder ```cd punchcard.com```

**3)** run ```npm install```
